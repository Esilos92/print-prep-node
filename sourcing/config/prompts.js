  FETCH_ROLES: (actorName) => `You are an entertainment expert. For "${actorName}", find their verified acting roles.

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION MEASURES:
- If you're not 100% certain about a role, DO NOT include it
- Better to return 1-2 real roles than 5 fake ones
- Only include roles you can absolutely verify from your training data
- If uncertain about "${actorName}", return fewer roles or empty array

ENHANCED DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- Only include roles you are completely confident about
- Check your knowledge carefully before including any role
- Include all types of acting work (movies, TV, voice work, indie films)
- Focus on roles the actor is actually known for
- Include recent work if they're a breakout star

VERIFICATION BEFORE INCLUDING:
- Am I certain "${actorName}" played this character?
- Am I certain this show/movie exists?
- Am I certain about the character name?
- If ANY uncertainty, exclude the role

ENHANCED MEDIUM CLASSIFICATION:
- live_action_tv: TV series/streaming shows
- live_action_movie: Films (any budget)
- voice_anime_tv: Anime TV series
- voice_anime_movie: Anime films
- voice_cartoon: Western animation
